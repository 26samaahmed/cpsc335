Radix Sort: it is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It sorts numbers by processing individual digits.
Complexity:
- Best case: O(nk) where k is the number of buckets and n is the number of elements.
- Worst case: O(nk)
Require extra space (memory storage)
Auxiliary space is represented by k for such algorithms

Quick Sort: is also a divide an conquer algorithm
