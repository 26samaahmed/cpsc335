Graphs: Data Structure

- Vertices (Nodes): Represent entities
- EdgesL Represent Relationships between those entities

Types of Graphs:

1. Directed Graph
2. Undirected Graph
3. Weighted Graph
4. Unweighed Graph
5. Cyclic vs Acrylis Graphs
6. Connected Graphs
7. Sparse vs Dense Graphs

Breadth First Search - 
* Explore neighbors level by level
* Uses queue (FIFO) for traversal
* Time Complexity = O(V + E)
* Space Complexity = O(V)
* Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph
* Real world application could be network broadcasting, web crawiling

Depth First Search -
* Explores neigbord deep as possible before backtracking
* Uses a stack (LIFO) for recursion
* Time Complexity = O(V + E)
* Space Complexity = O(V)
* Detecting cycles in a graph
* Topological sorting, Pathfinding in a maze
